      Vagrant will now create or start a local VM to act as the Docker
      host. You'll see the output of the `vagrant up` for this VM below.

    status:
      host_state_unknown: |-
        The host VM for the Docker containers appears to not be running
        or is currently inaccessible. Because of this, we can't determine
        the state of the containers on that host. Run `vagrant up` to
        bring up the host VM again.
      not_created: |-
        The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
        create the environment. If a machine is not created, only the
        default provider will be shown. So if a provider is not listed,
        then the machine is not created for that environment.

        cmd_not_set: |-
          The Docker command has not been set!
      docker_provider_nfs_without_privileged: |-
        You've configured a NFS synced folder but didn't enable privileged
        mode for the container. Please set the `privileged` option to true
        on the provider block from your Vagrantfile, recreate the container
        and try again.
      docker_provider_image_not_configured: |-
        The base Docker image has not been set for the '%{name}' VM!
      execute_error: |-
        A Docker command executed by Vagrant didn't complete successfully!
        The command run along with the output from the command is shown
        below.

      synced_folder_non_docker: |-
        The "docker" synced folder type can't be used because the  provider
        in use is not Docker. This synced folder type only works with the
        Docker provider. The provider this machine is using is: %{provider}
